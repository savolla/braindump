#+title: profiling decorator
#+filetags: :python:what_is:

It is a special python decorator which looks like =@profile=. You can use that decorator after you define the python profiling function somewhere in you code. And then put this decorator *above the function definition*.

It takes a function as argument. When you run the profiling decorator it starts the [[file:20210613164032-concept-code_profiling.org][code profiling]] first. Right after that it starts the passed function. When function is finished it stops the code profiling and prints out a [[file:20210613170953-concept-profile_report.org][profile report]]
