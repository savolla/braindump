Say we have the following results inside our profiling report;

| ncalls | cumtime | filename |
|--------+---------+----------|
|      1 |       6 | func1    |
|   5000 |       4 | func2    |
| 999999 |       2 | func3    |
|   5000 |    0.02 | func4    |

The slowest function is =func3=. If you see high =ncalls= that means this is a very *busy* function and doing most of the job in our program. =func2= and =func1= might look slow but actually they are *callers* of =func3=. When we fix =func3=, caller functions' performances will increase.
