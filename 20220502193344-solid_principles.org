* facts
* how to
* concepts
** SRP
+ about sizes of *classes* and *methods*
+ rules;
  a. every *operation* should be a separate class
  b. classes should be _small_
  c. class methods should be max 15-20 lines of code
+ SRP creates bunch of classes but here are the benefits;
  a. easier to debug
  b. new developers will adapt faster to codebase
  c. code is easier to read
  d. development speed increases

** OCP
+ about *interfaces*
+ rules;
  a. we should not modify the existing and already tested and working classes when new scenario comes out
  b. to extend the functionality use *Startegy Pattern*. it is like *Dependency Injection*
  c. violate this principle when your code has some bugs. open and modify the existing code to fix the issue
  d. if switch and case statements started to show up in methods it's time to apply _open close principle_

** LSP
+ about *subclasses*
** ISP
+ about *large interfaces*
** DIP
+ about *separating dependencies*
