Here I made some album recommendations. this is my personal playlist which consists of very "non-normie" stuff. albums in this list will start with the most "normie" music and will incrementally get heavier
** level 1
easier to digest and fun
+ [[https://tokyoroseofficial.com/album/chases-2][Tokyo Rose - Chases 2 ]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-14.png]]
  great synthwave album.. my favorite song on this is *midnight chase*
+ [[https://dancewiththedead.bandcamp.com/album/loved-to-death][Dance with the Dead - Loved to Death]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-15.png]]
  synthwave + some metal elements. great if you like distortion guitar riffs. this one includes *awesome* guitar solos. and the production is just incredible
+ [[https://alix2084.bandcamp.com/album/alix-2084-ep-2][ALIX 2084 (EP)]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-16.png]]
  directly jump to *Elevator Dance Party* song. great work and really underrated. those tempo changes will shake your brain inside
+ [[https://megadrive.bandcamp.com/album/hardwired-v14][Mega Drive - Hardwired V1.4]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-17.png]]
  *Dataline* *Dataline* *Dataline* !!
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5AiRVqfqk][Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works 85-92]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-18.png]]
  legent album from a legend
+ [[https://plini.bandcamp.com/album/sweet-nothings][Plini - Sweet Nothings]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-19.png]]
I bet this will be the sweetest thing you will ever listened. your ears will overflow with candies

** level 2
still electronic but with some interesting elements
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooYpuBd3gY][Heptaedium - "A M E N"]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-20.png]]
  did you ever listened to *break core*? edgy..
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzvLiwUK3R8][Aphex Twin Live at Field Day]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-21.png]]
  did you ever experienced ear bleeding? just skip to 1:51:00 and wait.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWzzNvcxY4w][Machine Girl - WLFGRL]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-124.png]]
  This album sounds like when you accidentally hit your nose a bit hard and it feels funny for a moment.

+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yb2l9Th9bs][FILMMAKER - VLAD TAPES]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-125.png]]
This is definitely the music that plays on mason parties.. Every work of FILMMAKER is loud, dense and hypnotic.

** level 3
still electronic but.. this time adding depression
+ [[https://boardsofcanada.bandcamp.com/album/twoism][Boards of Canada - Twoism]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-22.png]]
  this album might look harmless but wait until your soul evaporates completely

dark ambient passage. contains some depressive and horror materials. you also might want to stop there and enjoy 1st, 2nd and 3rd levels because things get non-normie here
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKa5LwFgAOA][Gates of Morheim - Omagatoki]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-25.png]]
  contains ethnic sounds. it's like a ritual music + dark ambient elements
+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3xQCMDz5Vs][Kurotokage - Call To The Deep]]

:END:
This is my personal *Equalizer Preference*. This is a result of one year of tweaking. Every Frequency is tuned and tested 1 Hz at a time. Tuned for the following genres;

- Djent
- Slam
- Break Core
- Brutal Death
- Technical Death
- Black Metal

 [[file:./images/screenshot-92.png]]

- I used *ATH-M40x* Studio headphones for tuning.
