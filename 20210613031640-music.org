This is my personal *Equalizer Preference*. This is a result of one year of tweaking. Every Frequency is tuned and tested 1 Hz at a time. Tuned for the following genres;

- Djent
- Slam
- Break Core
- Brutal Death
- Technical Death
- Black Metal

 [[file:./images/screenshot-92.png]]

- I used *ATH-M40x* Studio headphones for tuning.
