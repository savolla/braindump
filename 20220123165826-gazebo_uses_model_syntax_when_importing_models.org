#+title: gazebo uses model:// syntax when importing models
#+filetags: :ros:why:

gazebo sets an environment variable called *GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH* at startup. So this is a colon seperated value that tells gazebo where to find models. the model:// syntax represents those values. You can set them manually before launching gazebo.
