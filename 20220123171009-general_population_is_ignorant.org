#+title: general population is ignorant
#+filetags: :why:

Children of well-educated and well-income families are expected to have higher IQs than other children. Because while growing up, the intelligence impulse coming from the environment is more abundant and they are fed richer and more balanced than other children. In families with the opposite of this situation, children's IQ levels will be lower. As a result, the population in general will remain ignorant, as the number of families with income and well-education is less than others.
