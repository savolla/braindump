Turkish public speaker who specialized in [[file:20210613033811-diction.org][Diction]], communication and persuasion. He got into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters][Reuters]] by chance and completed very rare and expensive series of lectures about persuasion. Later on Reuters had to cancel those lectures because some members of ISIS and other Terrorism groups managed to get into these lectures. Mr. Topaloglu is the one of those 24 rare people in the world who can convince you to anything.
