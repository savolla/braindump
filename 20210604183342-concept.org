:END:
A [[file:20210604141054-concept.org][Computability Theory]] problem which says that "We can never have a program that can perfectly compress any given file". Because it depends to the file content which is used for simplification in compressing [[file:20210604183802-concept.org][Algorithm]]. Content may allow too much simplification like "ABCABCABC" where it is "3xABC" or it may contain characters string that never repeat.
