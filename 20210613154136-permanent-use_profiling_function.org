After we create a [[id:caddf693-f2d4-4b91-bab8-99fb2cd49c07][python profiling function]] we go to the *definition of the function* we want to profile and put the [[id:6745570c-16ff-4fcd-9343-5284e6a485ec][Python decorator]] above that function like this;

#+begin_src python
@profiler
def slowFunction():
    # some code
#+end_src
