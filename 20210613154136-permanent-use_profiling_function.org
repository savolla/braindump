After we create a [[id:92ee769b-8c4c-403c-92df-731a1dd56367][Python profiling function]] we go to the *definition of the function* we want to profile and put the [[id:96d6accb-3532-46c7-a3a3-ddf96b00871f][Python decorator]] above that function like this;

#+begin_src python
@profiler
def slowFunction():
    # some code
#+end_src
